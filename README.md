# VOTINGAPP
Voting App is an online voting application that was built to allow students to vote in the student government of a school. The system allows the central body in charge of the election to add the various contenders of the elections, the date of the election, the time the election should begin, and the time the elections should end. The system also allows the students taking part in the election to create accounts so as to vote. Elections begin automatically and students can vote in their chosen leaders and track their votes through hashes that are generated. Once the election end time is reached the elections end and the results are released automatically.
